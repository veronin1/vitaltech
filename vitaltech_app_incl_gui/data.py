"""
This file defines the UserData class which extends the Person class (via inheritance) to incorporate the actual userdata section of code. This performs health-related calculations and additional metrics like printing and storing the user data to text.
This design makes extensive use of inheritance, allowing the UserData class to build upon the foundamtional behaviours defined in the person class.
Encapsulation is also achieved by bundling both the data (attributes) and the functions (methods) that manipulate all the data into the same class, ensuring that the internal workings of this class are not accessible or modifiable otherwise.
This approach increases data integrity and reduces potential bugs.
As for coding standards in general, I used the Ruff linter to format the document to PEP 8 guidelines, and used OOP best practices to ensure that each method in the class had a single responsibility, whether it is calculating BMI, or converting the data to a dictionary etc.
Furthermore, the separation between core data processing and file I/O operations supports maintainability and scalability, enabling easy enhancements or modifications in the future.
